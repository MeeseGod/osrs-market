# OSRS Market
The OSRS market is a personal project that uses the Grand Exchange Database API to grab item information from the game Runescape and uses said information to create a fake marketplace for demonstration purposes.

## Why?
Originally I had a storefront application made to show off some of my CRUD skills but I found it lacking. I had always wanted to utilize a Runescape Grand Exchange API but at the time of the original app's creation I could not find an API to utilize. The original project had also been a stepping stone project to simply learn more about dynamic routing in React.

Since then I've learned a great deal and I wanted to create something a little more unique. Thus, the OSRS Market.
